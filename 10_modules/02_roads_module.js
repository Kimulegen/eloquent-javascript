/*
   * Write a CommonJS module, based on the example from Chapter 7, that
   * contains the array of roads and exports the graph data structure representing
   * them as `roadgraph`. It should depend on a module `./graph`, which exports a
   * function `buildgraph` that is used to build the graph. This function expects an
   * array of two-element arrays (the start and end points of the roads).
